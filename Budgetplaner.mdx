# Budgetplanner

## How it should work:

1. First of month receive email with link that leads to updating your income
2. After updating your income, you receive an email with your bugdet for this month, showing monthly, quartely and bi-yearly expenses for the current month.
3. The email should also included any quartely and bi-yearly expenses coming up within the next three months

## Flow

12/03

- Receive email asking you to input accurate Income_names
- After income is updated an email is sent with an overview over this months net income

## Views

- Update incomes page
- Expenses that shows all income with name, category, 1 expense and how many times a year its paid
- Expenses shown over a year as a calender view
- Income view

## Todo

- Subtract expenses from income in order to see what is leftover
- When the income has been updated, trigger the subtraction and send email out with current budget
- Make email phone friendly

## What I have done

- Postgress database hooked up with python backend
- Tables for
  - Income
  - Expenses
- Logic for placing expenses in the month they belong // calculate_expenses.python
- Create email with expenses for a month that included the next three months of not quarterly and bi yearly expenses
