# Budgetplanner

## How it should work:

1. First of month receive email with link that leads to updating your income
2. After updating your income, you receive an email with your bugdet for this month, showing monthly, quartely and bi-yearly expenses for the current month.
3. The email should also included any quartely and bi-yearly expenses coming up within the next three months

## Phases and MVPs

### Phase 1 MVPs

1. Login view
2. View for updating income
3. Backend logic that calculates expenses for each month
4. Netincome is calculated by subtracting expense from total income
5. Email is sent out that gives an overview over these

### Phase 2 MVPs

1. View for expenses that shows all expenses with name, category, how much value is and how many times a year its paid (See reference image 1)
2. View for expenses shown over a year as a calender view (See reference image 2)
3. View for income (See reference image 2)

### Phase 3 MVPs

1. View for Dashboard
2. Sign up view
